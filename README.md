<i>Exercism Notebook • Python Track</i>

<p>Hello!</p>

<p>📝This is my online notebook with <b>Python's</b> exercises developed on exercism.org.</p>
<p>👣 Here I'll write down my solutions and also the step-by-step explanation of how I explained the exercise to myself. </p>

<p>🧠🐍 I come from a humanities background and I am developing my logical/mathematical brain while studying Python. </p>
<p>💐 It may be that by sharing my notes someone else can benefit too.</p>

Let's go together!
